# Hive Battle Sim

** Simulate battle outcomes in the dark future of the Underhive. **

## Motivation

I am a big fan of Necromunda. I'd love to play a campaign, but none of my friends play. So, I am writing this app to generate battle outcomes for my own solo campaign.

## Current Features

 - Randomly generate a simple roster
 
## Current Roadmap

 - Track Ascendency, Territory, Lasting Injuries, Captures
 - Persist data to data store of some kind
 - Web front end

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `hive_battle_sim` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:hive_battle_sim, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
